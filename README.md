# Smart-Walking-stick-for-the-Blind
Use of UltraSonic sensors to alert the user of the obstacles.

# Detecting obstacles using Ultrasonic Sensors
We are using Two Ultrasonic Sensors at an angle of 75 degrees on eithes sides of the line of path. Each of the sensor can detect obstacle at a range of 70 centimeters. A buzzer is placed on the stick which will produce three different sounds for obstacles on all the three directions(Left, Right, Center).

# INSTALLATION
You need an Arduino(Uno) board, two Tltrasonic sensors, a buzzer, a bread board and a walking stick.

# Note
The program was designed and verified Arduino(1.8.5) and was tested on Arduino(Uno) board. It was then implemented on the walking stick. The images of the stick has also been uploaded.

# Run
After using the stick it gave the desired sound for the obstracle on each side.
